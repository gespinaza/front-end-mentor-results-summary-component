## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- Keep learning about flex properties

### Continued development

My challenge is to complete 10 newbie projects and then move to the next ones using bootstrap o js.
In this project i didn't pay attention to the big screens (What happens when you move your winndow to a monitor screen). Still have to manage that missing task.
