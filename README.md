## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid Layouts
- RWD



### What I learned

- I leaned hot to use grid layouts for this challenge and how to manage the responsive web design in a newbie way.
- Also keep learning about the basics.



### Continued development

My challenge is to complete 10 newbie projects and then move to the next ones using bootstrap o js.
In this project i didn't pay attention to the big screens (What happens when you move your winndow to a monitor screen). Still have to manage that missing task.
